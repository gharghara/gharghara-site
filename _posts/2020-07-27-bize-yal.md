*Bize yalnız oğulları asılmış bir kadının* is a piece by Mehmet Nemutlu.
Title comes from poet İsmet Özel.<br/> 

Two things I like about this piece:  
1. The stemlets of my designation. I like calling them serif-stemlets. These do not occupy our nervature as the conventional stemlets do, easier on the brain.

2. The tuplet numbers with a masking backer when they are inside the staff. The number is clearly spotted that way. This is a bit tricky to implement in Lilypond.

I used the code 

{% highlight ruby %}

#(define-music-function (parser location adds)(pair?)

    (define (flexible-stencil-whiteout add stencil)
      (let*
          ((x-ext (ly:stencil-extent stencil X))
           (y-ext (ly:stencil-extent stencil Y)))
        (ly:stencil-add
         (stencil-with-color
            (ly:round-filled-box
               (interval-widen x-ext (car add))
               (interval-widen y-ext (cdr add))
               0.3)
            red)
         stencil)))

    (define more-stencil-whiteout
      (lambda (grob)
           (let* ((stil (ly:tuplet-number::print grob))
                  (x-ext (ly:stencil-extent stil X))
                  (y-ext (ly:stencil-extent stil Y))
                  (whiteout-stil (flexible-stencil-whiteout adds stil)))
             (ly:make-stencil
                (ly:stencil-expr whiteout-stil)
                x-ext
                y-ext))))
    #{
     
      \once \override TupletNumber.stencil = #more-stencil-whiteout
      \once \override TupletNumber.color = #white
    #})

{% endhighlight %}

and added some rotation to the backer so that the upper-right corner of the number equally benefits from some relief.
