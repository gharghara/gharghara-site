Two things I like about this piece:  
1. The stemlets of my designation. I like calling them serif-stemlets.  
2. The tuplet numbers with a masking backer when they are inside the staff. The number is clearly spotted that way. I used the code from more-whiteout-stencil and added some rotation to the backer so that the upper-right corner of the number equally benefits from some relief.

Update:
After 2.21 release with proper french-beams plus other personal adjustments.
