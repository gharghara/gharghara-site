### On language,
### You can find on bet.Gharghara:,
### A word on bet.Gharghara,

If any of the content is in a language (or a writing system) that means something to you... I did all I can, apparently. Church. Do not use Google Translate, just leave it. Available content options are at the moment: words in Turkish, words in English, music, maybe some Lilypond related code, maybe some... It is good to know that Google Translate or Amazon or OpenAI does not translate music as of now.

Gharghara is about to entertain with a dropped h &mdash; for a reason. Here you will find: Lilypond shit, Sibelius shit, excerpts from scores, words, all piled up. Again feel free to enjoy the content again.

Do not share, do not distribute, any material yourself if you are a blockhead (like myself) and if you are not concsious of your actions. Sharing is not always your best friend. Instead, send them a link: [gharghara.in](gharghara.in)

Finally, always, and forever, hesitate.
